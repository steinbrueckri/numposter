# numposter

Typographic **A3+ (329 x 483 mm)** posters that visualise mathematical
patterns and number-theoretic phenomena as text-based halftone compositions.

Python + Pillow generate a grayscale mask from the poster's symbol, then
fill a grid of monospaced text whose per-character shade follows the mask.
The result is compiled to PDF via XeLaTeX.

## Posters

### Digital Root of 9

Every multiple of 9 has a digit sum that, through repeated reduction,
equals 9. The poster surface is tiled with examples like
`9x53=477 | 4+7+7=18 -> 1+8=9` and forms a large **9** as a halftone
composition.

**Why does this work?** In base 10, each power of 10 satisfies
10^k ≡ 1 (mod 9). A number N = d_k · 10^k + ... + d_0 is therefore
congruent to d_k + ... + d_0 (mod 9). Since 9 · n ≡ 0 (mod 9), the
digit sum must reduce to 9.

### Alternating Digit Sum (11)

A number is divisible by 11 if and only if its alternating digit sum
d_0 − d_1 + d_2 − d_3 + ... is divisible by 11. The composition
forms **11**.

**Why does this work?** Because 10 ≡ −1 (mod 11), so
10^k ≡ (−1)^k (mod 11). The alternating sum of digits therefore equals
the number modulo 11.

### Primes

The surface is filled with ascending primes generated by trial division.

Prime numbers — integers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and
themselves — become sparser as numbers grow, yet they never run out
(Euclid's theorem). The Prime Number Theorem tells us that around a large
number N, roughly 1 in ln(N) integers is prime.

### Collatz

The Collatz conjecture (also known as the 3n + 1 problem) states: start
with any positive integer n; if even, halve it; if odd, compute 3n + 1;
repeat. The conjecture — still unproven — claims that every starting value
eventually reaches 1. The poster text shows individual trajectories like
`7: 7->22->11->34->...->1`. The halftone mask shows a **tree** — every
number flows toward 1 like branches converging to a trunk.

### π (Pi)

The decimal digits of π fill the poster surface. Each character is one
digit; the layout forms the symbol **π**.

π is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is
irrational (Lambert, 1768) and transcendental (Lindemann, 1882), meaning
it cannot be the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.

- Export: `build/{poster}_{scheme}.pdf`

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (dependency management)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (command runner)
- XeLaTeX **or** Docker (for PDF compilation)

## Usage

```bash
just fetch-font              # download Fira Mono (one-time)
just build                   # build all posters & schemes (local XeLaTeX)
just build primes ember      # build primes poster, ember scheme
just build-docker            # build all posters using Docker (no local LaTeX needed)
```

Pre-built PDFs are checked in via Git LFS and can be downloaded directly
from the repository without building.
